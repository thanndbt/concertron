# Concertron

Concertron is a tool that will scrape concert agendas from music venues. It will start out small, focussing on my favourite venues in the Netherlands. However, I hope to expand this beyond that and eventually turn it into a telegram bot or something.

This is a learning-as-I-go type project, learning more about scraping, databases, efficient programming etc.

## Web app

The project currently has a simple flask app powered by Bootstrap and jQuery to create a simple but effective AI with basic filtering. It is by no means an end product.

It contains a tagger (/tagger) to manually sort out the tags collected from the various venue web pages.
